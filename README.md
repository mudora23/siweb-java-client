# SIWeb+ Java Client
**SIWeb+ Java Client** is the client side of our brand new SIWeb+ application.

**SIWeb+** is a fully featured student management system and student portal for administrators, lecturers, and students. SIWeb+ provides students with a centralized location to access all the information and resources they need.

## Software Development Process
We adopted **Scrum - an Agile project management and product development framework**. We broke down the project into smaller, manageable tasks and iterative progress. It helped the team to a deliver high-quality application more efficiently by focusing on a small set of features at any given time. Moreover, Agile (Scrum) allows us to give the top priority to our stakeholders (Students, Lecturers, and Administrators), starting from the very first step of the software development life cycle.

Our target market is small to medium education authorities which have obsolete or non-functional student management systems.


## Software Development Plan

### Development Process

1. **Requirement analysis**
Product Owner gathers and understands the key requirements from students, lecturers, and adminstrators. Create a list of features required and put them to the product backlog.

2. **Sprint Planning**
Select items from the product backlog (work for 2 - 4 weeks) for the upcoming sprint. 

3. **Daily standups**
Daily standups meetings to update each other on progress, and identify any issues.

4. **Sprint Execution**
Develop the items from the sprint planning.

5. **Sprint Review and retrospective**
Demonstrate the completed work to students, lecturers, adminstrators. Gather feedbacks and discuss with the team for improvements needed.

6. **Repeat**
Move on the next sprint with improved processes.
