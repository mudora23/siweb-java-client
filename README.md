# SIWeb+ Java Client
**SIWeb+ Java Client** is the client side of our brand new SIWeb+ application.

**SIWeb+** is a fully featured and comprehensive student management system for students, lecturers, and administrators. It features a modern, visually appealing UX/UI and an intuitive interface that results in an excellent user experience.

Another primary feature that SIWeb+ offers is providing students with a centralized location to access all the information and resources they need. With easier access to learning materials and streamlined communication with lecturers, this application is designed to propel students towards success.

## Software Development Process
We adopted **Scrum - an Agile project management and product development framework** to break down the project into smaller, manageable tasks and facilitate iterative progress. This approach enabled the team to deliver a high-quality application more efficiently by focusing on a limited set of features at any given time. Moreover, Agile (Scrum) allows us to prioritize the needs of our stakeholders (students, lecturers, and administrators) from the very beginning of the software development life cycle.

Our target market consists of small to medium-sized educational institutions that currently have outdated or non-functional student management systems.

## Software Development Plan

### Development Process

1. **Requirement analysis**
    Product Owner gathers and understands the key requirements from students, lecturers, and administrators. Create a list of features required and put them to the product backlog.

2. **Sprint Planning**
    Select items from the product backlog (work for 2 - 4 weeks) for the upcoming sprint. 

3. **Daily standups**
    Daily standups meetings to update each other on progress and identify any issues.

4. **Sprint Execution**
    Develop the items from the sprint planning.

5. **Sprint Review and retrospective**
    Demonstrate the completed work to students, lecturers, administrators. Gather feedback and discuss with the team for the improvements needed.

6. **Repeat**
    Move on the next sprint with improved processes.
